## Chain definition language

Chainblocks wants to be a meta language or a visual language rather then a pure language but to nicely describe
chains and the data they contain we adopt and write a simple language based on EDN and Clojure.
Notice that in theory any language can be used, this was just a pragmatic choice.
In fact you will also find chains written in C++ digging the chainblocks codebase.

You can basically think of it as a comprehensible JSON on steroids that can be evaluated or the Ansible of general programming.

The exection of each of these scripts is meant to be fast, the script language is just a description of the computational graph.
The runtime itself is completely detached.

Basically load, define the chain/s, attach them to a node and kick off the runtime.

### Super simple example

``` lisp
; define a node
(defnode main)
; define a simple hello world looped chain
(defloop hello-world
  (Msg "Hello world"))
; schedule the chain for exection
(schedule main hello-world)
; run the node at 1 second intervals
(run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
```
