# Contributing to the wiki

The wiki for each repository is located at the respective repository's URL path + '/wiki'.

For example the wiki for Chainblocks is at :

https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/chainblocks/wiki

You are encouraged to contribute code recipes, game performance/ optimization techniques, or anything else that might be useful to the Fragcolor Chainblocks community, to this wiki.

## Request collaborator access
To be able to edit the Wiki of a repository you need to have collaborator access to that repository.

*For now you can request collaborator access by opening an issue in the repository and tagging the maintainer.*

Once you have collaborator access, you'll be able to see the Edit and New Page buttons on the upper right-hand side of the Wiki page.

## Edit page

To edit an existing page select it from the right-hand TOC table.

Clicking on **Edit** will open the selected page in edit mode in Github's own built-in editor (you can select the Editor Format from the Edit Mode dropdown.)

![Add Page button ](assets/setup-wiki_add-page.png)

An Edit Message can be optionally added (equivalent of a Commit Message) and the edit can be saved using the Save button at the bottom of the editor.
