# Getting started

## Stack components
The Fragcolor ecosystem has the primary components (each in a different state of development right now):

- Chainblocks open-scripting programming language
- Hasten creativity engine (to build apps, games and open worlds)
- Clamor protocol and networking stack

## How to start

You need to have Git, a GitHub account, and a code editor (we recommend VS Code).

*If you're not familiar with Git and the GitHub workflow please read the [Installations](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/01.installations/) and [Making changes](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/02.making-changes/) sections in the Docs Contribution guide first.*

To contribute code to any of these programs you need to build them from sources on your local machine.

The following sections document this process but you may also read the relevant repository's README files for more details.
