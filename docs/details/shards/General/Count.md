`Count` parses the value passed to it in the `:Name` parameter, and returns the count of characters, elements, or key-value pairs depending on whether the data type passed to it was a string, a sequence, or a table.

Input field is not applicable for this shard and its output is the count value in `Int` type.

This shard will always return a zero count if applied to numbers.
